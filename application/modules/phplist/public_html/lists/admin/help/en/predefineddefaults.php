Countries in the world, States in the USA, Counties in 
the UK, etc. 
You can upload these automatically instead of adding other attributes manually. <ol> <li>Select <strong> 
Add </strong> to 
include 
a 
default predefined attribute as one of your initial attributes.</li> 
<li> After an attribute has been added, 
select 
<strong> Return to editing </strong>  attributes.</li>
<li> Attribute 1, or the predefined attribute that was just added, will appear on the following screen.
